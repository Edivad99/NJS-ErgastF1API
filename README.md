## Getting Started
## Instructions for Use Using Docker Compose

- install docker
- download and unzip the contents repository 
- cd into the root folder and run: `docker-compose up --build -d --remove-orphans`
- give everything a minute or to to come up and then test the API at: `http://localhost:8080/`

- driverStandings
- constructorStandings
- laps
- pitstop

### Example
- Returns all the drivers who raced in 2019 : `http://localhost:8080/drivers?year=2019`
